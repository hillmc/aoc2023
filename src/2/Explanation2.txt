100 games. Might as well do by hand
Criteria is: reject >12 red, >13 green, >14 blue

Load in editor - remove all with *any* value over 14

save as input-obvious, approx 50 games

save as input-cleaned

extracting game numbers (have colons so can't use awk $2)

cut c6,7 input-cleaned
...beware loses the 100 0 digit (so has 10) must add 90

so

cut c6,7,8 input-cleaned >okgames

to get the numbers and colons and then

grep -o '^[0-9]*' okgames >okgames2

Games acceptable

awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum}' okgames2 
2721

Yay! Gold star!

Part 2 is minimum of each colour. By hand? Arse! Oh alright then...
